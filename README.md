We found a height to stride constant of .414

We have several branches-- the majority of the work we are currently doing is on the Demo branch.

# Software
We got this Myo experiment running using:
-Vizard 5.1
-Unity Version 5.3.2f1 (e87ab445ead0) Personal
-Myo SDK for windows version 0.9.0 (already plugin for myo_Experiment)
-Oculus SDK version 0.8.0.0

# DIRECTORIES
## Myo\_Experiment
This is the work for Spring 2016.
It is a Unity project with:
-Myo March
-Myo Armswing
-and Tracking support

## ROLLABALL
This is the playground where we started developing the things we used in Myo Experiment.
Well, until it got horribly gross.
We were tracking unnecessary files,
so we decided to jump ship and create a new project.

## Submissions
This contains write-ups for conference and paper submissions.

## Utilities
This contains code and files which are necessary for running Myo Experiment,
but are not necessarily part of the lab.
Currently, the script that generates the random orders to visit objects, etc.,
is in here.

## RESOURCES
This contains some zip files which we needed for running our previous Kinect Experiments.

## ENVIRONMENT
I don't know what is in the file, or why we have it...
